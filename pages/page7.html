			<h3> Un peu d'anglais : Why do you like reptiles ? </h3>
			<p>
				 Le reste de cette page sera entiérement écrite en anglais 
			</p>
			<p>
				 Since I was a kid, I was fascinated by reptiles because I thought 
				<br>
				they were related to dinosaurs, but today I know that dinosaurs are more 
				<br>
				 related to reptiles. Nowadays, this passion is still growing, 
				<br>
				 and I recently learned a lot about reptiles. In my opinion, reptiles 
				<br>
				 are a category of animal that are very interesting, due to the diversity of animals
				<br>
				 we can put inside this category like: crocodile, snake,
				<br>
				 lizard and turtle, inside each of them we have some beautiful has 
				<br>
				 we used to see with the GreenTree python
				<br>
				 The other thing I really like about reptiles is I learned 
				<br>
				 a lot of scientific things with them, 
				<br>
				like what was parthenogenesis or Ontogenetic niche shift.
				<br>
				I also learned a lot about how genetics work with reptiles like snakes and 
				<br>
				how someone can bring out some colorful species that don't exist in the wild like those.
				<br>
				In my opinion, reptiles are animals that are underrated inside the domestics animal, 
				<br>
				animal like snake and lizard are more docile that what cliché inside fiction spread about them,
				<br>
				reptiles are calm, interesting to watch and interact, they have a long lifespan 
				<br>
				(~20 years old, some kind of reptiles like ball python can live more than 20 years) 
				<br>
				compared to animals likes dogs, cat or hamster.
				<br>
				The negative points with these types of animals are 
				<br>
				 that some of them need a big enclosure, a UV lamp and need to be heated,
				<br>
				 and some of them especially imported the reptile are easy to stress, but in terms of food,
				<br>
				 plus inside the enclosure reptiles don't need so much food compared to dogs or cats, 
				<br>
				 they also don't have to walk, 
				<br>
				 you can make a beautiful background like here: where the vivarium literally
				<br>
				 looks like a piece of jungle that we have taken.
